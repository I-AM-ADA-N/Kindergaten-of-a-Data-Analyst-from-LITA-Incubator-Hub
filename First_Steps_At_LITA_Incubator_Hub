FIRST_STEPS_AT_LITA_INCUBATOR_HUB

I began my career in Sales andmarketing but gradually, my professional interests has shifted to Business Administration.

In my current role as dealer and distributor, business intelligence has become a focus especially concerning customer information, re-ordering and data! 

Having just concluded elementary and intermediate classes in Ms Excel, SQL and Power BI for Data Analysis at the Incubator Hub, I have become a continous data analyst and an aspiring senior business 
intelligence.

On this journey, I am willing and ready to collaborate with a top-rated data analytics organisation whose mission is to forge strategic partnerships for scaling businesses.
